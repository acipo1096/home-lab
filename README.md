## Computer

### Background

In 2019, I earned my first IT certification, the CompTIA A+. While I was happy my hard work paid off, and while I could describe all the parts of a PC, I had never really taken a PC apart before. I knew my certification would be more meaningful if I could back it up with a tangible project. So in January 2020, I headed over to Micro Center and got the parts I needed.

### Parts

I used the following components in my PC:
- CPU
- 16 GB RAM (I'd eventually upgrade to 32 GB of RAM a few years later)
- Motherboard
- SanDisk 1TB SSD. Later, after my old MacBook Pro 2012 was recycled, I removed the Samsung 1TB SSD from that machine and inserted it into my PC to be used as a hard drive for my games
- Graphics Card
- Operating System: Windows 10 for Education
- Case

### Impact

I built my PC just in time. Barely a month later, COVID had taken over the world, and I eventually found myself furloughed and under lockdown. My new machine was the perfect start to begin working on home practice labs to hone the skills I had earned in two other certifications, the CompTIA Network+ and Security+. It was also a great machine to start running Cisco CCNA labs and begin working on my coding skills. And for the moments I wanted a break, I could play old games on Steam!

### Future Plans

Unfortunately, my computer will not support Windows 11. I plan to build a newer, better PC within the next year. I intend to turn my current PC into a Proxmox server, which I can use to host web apps, additional file storage, and maybe home automation.
